# DSML_Employee_Analysis
This project demonstrates how to load, manipulate, and analyze data from an Excel file using Python. It involves preprocessing the dataset, making modifications, and generating insights through programmatic operations.

Preprocessing Steps
You should document the actual preprocessing steps you performed.

Missing Data Handling:
Did you drop rows, fill with mean/median, or use other imputation methods?

Data Type Conversion:
Mention specific columns converted (e.g., 'OrderDate' converted to datetime format).

Outliers:
Specify how you handled outliers (e.g., "Removed data points above 99th percentile").

Categorical Encoding:
If you encoded categories, explain how (e.g., "Used one-hot encoding for the 'Region' column").

Analysis Tasks
Update these based on the analysis you performed:

Descriptive Statistics:
Mention which summary statistics you calculated (mean, median, mode, etc.).

Trend Analysis:
Specify which trends you identified (e.g., monthly sales increase).

Correlation Analysis:
State which variables you analyzed for relationships (e.g., "Found strong correlation between marketing spend and revenue").

Segmentation:
Mention how you grouped the data (e.g., "Segmented customers based on age group and region").


Insights
Sales peak during the holiday season in November and December.
The Western region contributes 35% of total revenue.
Customers aged 25-34 have the highest purchase frequency.
